		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Flutter Project with Firebase Integration",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Flutter project setup with Firebase integration into subtasks including project initialization, dependency management, Firebase project configuration, and platform-specific setup for iOS and Android.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple platforms (iOS/Android) and several Firebase services. While it's a standard setup process, it requires careful configuration of multiple dependencies and platform-specific files. The complexity comes from ensuring all Firebase services are properly initialized and configured across platforms."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement User Authentication Flow",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the user authentication flow implementation into subtasks covering UI design for login/signup screens, Firebase Authentication integration, user profile creation in Firestore, authentication state management, and password reset functionality.",
			"reasoning": "Authentication involves both UI and backend integration with Firebase. The complexity comes from handling various authentication states, error cases, and security considerations. It also requires Firestore integration for user profiles and proper state management across the app."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Build Core UI Components and Navigation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the core UI components and navigation implementation into subtasks covering theme setup, navigation structure, screen implementations, reusable component creation, accessibility features, and responsive design.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating the entire UI foundation for the app with multiple screens and components. The complexity is high due to the need for consistent theming, responsive layouts, accessibility considerations, and a robust navigation system that works across all app states."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Mock Data Service",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the mock data service implementation into subtasks covering service interface design, mock data generation for all entity types, and factory pattern implementation for switching between mock and real services.",
			"reasoning": "This task is relatively straightforward as it involves creating hardcoded data structures and simulated delays. The complexity comes from ensuring the mock data accurately reflects the Firebase data structure and implementing a clean factory pattern for service switching."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Google Maps Integration with Hotspot Display",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Google Maps integration into subtasks covering API setup, platform configuration, map implementation with hotspot markers, location services integration, and marker clustering optimization.",
			"reasoning": "Maps integration involves complex API configuration, location permissions, custom marker rendering, and performance optimization. The complexity is increased by the need to handle user location tracking, marker clustering for performance, and custom styling of map elements."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Cleanup Submission Flow",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the cleanup submission flow into subtasks covering multi-step UI flow, camera integration, location verification, form validation, offline support, and submission handling.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex as it combines multiple device features (camera, GPS), multi-step UI flow, form validation, and offline capabilities. It's the core feature of the app and requires careful implementation of each step with proper error handling and user feedback."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement User Dashboard and Leaderboards",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the dashboard and leaderboards implementation into subtasks covering personal statistics visualization, achievement display, leaderboard UI with filtering, data refresh mechanisms, and social sharing features.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves complex data visualization, real-time updates, and potentially large datasets for leaderboards. The complexity comes from creating performant visualizations, implementing proper pagination for leaderboards, and ensuring a responsive UI with animations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Replace Mock Data with Firebase Integration",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Firebase integration into subtasks covering Firestore data service implementation, Storage service for images, real-time listeners, error handling and retry logic, offline support, and security rules configuration.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves replacing all mock services with real Firebase implementations, which requires careful handling of asynchronous operations, error cases, and offline scenarios. The complexity is high due to the need for real-time data synchronization, proper security rules, and handling edge cases like network failures."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Cloud Functions for AI Verification",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Cloud Functions implementation into subtasks covering development environment setup, cleanup verification function, Cloud Vision API integration, user stats update logic, and monitoring/logging implementation.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves server-side code with complex AI integration and database transactions. The complexity is very high due to the need to analyze images with Vision API, implement verification algorithms, handle Firestore transactions for user updates, and set up proper monitoring and error handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Performance Optimization and Final Testing",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the performance optimization and testing into subtasks covering image caching strategies, Firestore data caching, startup time optimization, performance monitoring implementation, comprehensive testing across all requirements, and analytics integration.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves optimizing the entire application across multiple dimensions (network, memory, CPU) and conducting thorough testing. The complexity is high because it requires deep understanding of Flutter performance patterns, Firebase best practices, and comprehensive test coverage across functional and non-functional requirements."
